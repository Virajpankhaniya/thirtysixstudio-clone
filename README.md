# Thirtysixstudio Clone

Welcome to the **Thirtysixstudio Clone** project! This is a React application that mimics the design and functionality of the original Thirtysixstudio website, enhanced with smooth animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and smooth scrolling powered by the `locomotivemtl` package.
